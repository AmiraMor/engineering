<br>Week 3<br>
<br><u>This week, we started working on our rub-goldberg machine.First, we created a three- d model of the machine, then sketched it out on a cardboard sheet. Today, we did a boat challenge with paper.</u>
<br><br>
<br> Week 4<br>
<br><u>This week, we built our rub goldberg machine. We created all the parts out of cardboard so that the machine would pop the balloon. We finished the machine and tested it out. it took a few tries to pop the balloon, because the needle wasn't sharp enough. We changed the needle after a few tries and the balloon sucessfully popped. The machine consisted of a ramp with a pully system. The pully system held marbles, so when it was activated, the marbles would roll down the ramp onto a sea saw, which had a needle on the other end that popped the balloon.</u><br>

<br>Week 6<br>
<br><u>This week, we made the blueprints for a prosthetic for an animal of our choice. I chose to make a skin prostetic for an orca whale. I looked up the layers of an orcas skin and created my prothetic off of that.</u><br>

<br> Week 7<br>
<br><u>This week, we learned about Aerospace and Astronautial Engineering. We covered this and were introduced to our new project. Our new project is consructing a bottle rocket. We started assembling our designs for the project on CAD. We did a challege on thursday where we made flying paper and tried to hit a box.</u><br>
<br>
<br>Week 8<br>
<br><u>This week, we made a bottle rocket. We first made the CAD, and then we assembled it out of a bottle, cardstock, and tape. Then, we tested the rocket out using a pressured water system.</u>

<br>Week 9<br>
<br><u>This week, we talked a bit about environmental engineering, and talked about what this subfield encompasses. We did an activity on thursday. We went outside as a group and filtered water. We used a bottle and filled it with a cotton ball, sand, and rocks, and put dirty water through it to be filtered.<u/><br>
