<br>Week 1<br>
<br><u>This week, we started using our websites. We played around with different tools. We coded our first journal entry.</u><br>
<br><b>Week 2</b><br>
<u>This week, we started using CAD. We played around with it on the first day. On the second day, we created an appliance.</html></u>

<br>Week 3<br>
<br><u>This week, we started working on our rub-goldberg machine.First, we created a three- d model of the machine, then sketched it out on a cardboard sheet. Today, we did a boat challenge with paper.</u>
<br><br>
<br> Week 4<br>
<br><u>This week, we built our rub goldberg machine. We created all the parts out of cardboard so that the machine would pop the balloon. We finished the machine and tested it out. it took a few tries to pop the balloon, because the needle wasn't sharp enough. We changed the needle after a few tries and the balloon sucessfully popped. The machine consisted of a ramp with a pully system. The pully system held marbles, so when it was activated, the marbles would roll down the ramp onto a sea saw, which had a needle on the other end that popped the balloon.</u><br>

<br>Week 5<br>
<br><u>This week, we were given a project. We had to disassemble a pc computer and put it back together. We were given tools and a slide to use. </u><br>

<br>
<br>Week 6<br>
<br><u>This week, we made the blueprints for a prosthetic for an animal of our choice. I chose to make a skin prostetic for an orca whale. I looked up the layers of an orcas skin and created my prothetic off of that.</u><br>

<br>
<br> Week 7<br>
<br><u>This week, we learned about Aerospace and Astronautial Engineering. We covered this and were introduced to our new project. Our new project is consructing a bottle rocket. We started assembling our designs for the project on CAD. We did a challege on thursday where we made flying paper and tried to hit a box.</u><br>
<br>
<br>Week 8<br>
<br><u>This week, we made a bottle rocket. We first made the CAD, and then we assembled it out of a bottle, cardstock, and tape. Then, we tested the rocket out using a pressured water system.</u>

<br>Week 9<br>
<br><u>This week, we talked a bit about environmental engineering, and talked about what this subfield encompasses. We did an activity on thursday. We went outside as a group and filtered water. We used a bottle and filled it with a cotton ball, sand, and rocks, and put dirty water through it to be filtered.<u/><br>

<br>Week 10<br>
<br><u>This week, we started the unit on electrical engineering and went through a slide presentation. We started working with CAD and learned what a breadboard is. We started experimenting with circuitry and tried to make led lights work.</u>

<br><br>
<br> Week 10<br>
<br><u>This week, we worked on a led system and got to worked with a breadboard. We tried to replicate our CAD, but some of our trials did not work out. We also did a "would you rather" challenge that related to engineering" </u><br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 11</u><br>
<br> This week was Thanksgiving break, so we were off from school<br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 12</u><br>
<br> This week, we were introduced to our final project, the spagetti bridge. Every group was given 100 spagetti pieces to build a bridge out of, prototypes, and our final bridge had to only consiist of 20 pieces of pasta. Our only supplies is wood glue and the pasta. We made a sketch of a possible bridge.<br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 13</u><br>
<br> This week, We made our first prototype of the spagetti bridge. We cut about 10 spagetties into 10 pieces, one inch long. We then glued 3 of the small pieces together to be extra sturdy. we then made two long rods and glued the small pieces along it, like a train track. but it broke because it stuck to the cardboard we glued the bridge on. So, we started again.<br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 14</u><br>
<br> This week, we made two new prototypes, one similar to our first, and the other had a thick supporting rod in the center of the bridge. Our second prototype broke, so we glued the whole bridge together. Then we tested both and the glue bridge tore with about 5 cups of water and the other bridge held 6 and broke.<br>

<br><br>
<br><u>Week 15</u><br>
<br> This week, we made our final bridge, which consisted of three rods and the small pieces of pasta lying on top of the rods. We glued everything together and it held a lot of water.It was very supportive<br>

<br> SEMESTER 2 <br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 1</u><br>
<br> This week, we were introduced to our new project. We will either be creating an arduino car, a mouse trap car, or a campus research project. My partner, Albany, and I chose to go with the campus research project<br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 2</u><br>
<br> This week, we decided that our campus research project was going to be a plumbing system that solved the issue with the gross school bathrooms. We went and took pictures of the bathrooms and analysized them. We chose a drainage system that would help drain all that water that sits on the floors. We then wrote our project proposal, which was five pages long.<br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 3</u><br>
<br>This week, we made our tile system. We made the system where there was a small pipe in between each four-way intersection of the tiles. We then made a CAD of our design.<br>
<br><img src="DRAINAGETILE.jpeg" width ="200px" height = "100"><br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 4</u><br>
<br>This week, we started sketching our full design of the plumbing tile system. We made our first ideration of the design, where the top was four tiles made of cardboard, the tile pipes were two thin straws, the connecting pipe was a boba straw, and everything being stuck together with hot glue. we went off of this design as we made our real prototype.<br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 5</u><br>
<br> This week, Albany bought clay and we started making the tiles. We measured out the tiles and cut space for the pipes. We made a total of 9 tiles.<br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 6</u><br>
<br> This week, we realized that we made the tiles the wrong size for the tubing that we got. We broke up the tiles and reverted it back to clay. So we started again making the tiles. We remeasured and made room for shrinking.<br>
<br><br>

<br><u>Week 7</u><br>
<br> This week, our tiles dried by the last day of the week, so we stuck them together then. We used spackle to stick them together.<br>
<br><img src="tile4.jpeg" width ="200px" height = "100"><br>
<br><br>
<br><u>Week 8</u><br>
<br> This week, we realized that the spackle wasnt the best plastering agent and we had to go a different route. So we took some of our left over clay and stuck the tiles together. We created a clay/paper machay mixture that stuck the tiles together, and it worked pretty well.<br>

<br><br>
<br><u>Week 9</u><br>
<br> This week, we got Mr. Pool to drill the holes in our tube and we tested out our design. It worked pretty well. I think if we had spent more money on the project, it would have worked better, but for what it is, it did the job.<br>
