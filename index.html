<br> Week 3<br>
<br><u>This week, we built our rub goldberg machine. We created all the parts out of cardboard so that the machine would pop the balloon. We finished the machine and tested it out. it took a few tries to pop the balloon, because the needle wasn't sharp enough. We changed the needle after a few tries and the balloon sucessfully popped. The machine consisted of a ramp with a pully system. The pully system held marbles, so when it was activated, the marbles would roll down the ramp onto a sea saw, which had a needle on the other end that popped the balloon.</u><br>
